  - COVR-X1860 (A1)


Minor changes
-------------

* Nodes using a fastd VPN connection now report the negotiated method on the status page
  (`#2465 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/2465>`_)


Bugfixes
--------

* Fixed hostapd being unable to start an AP when selecting channel 116/120 with HT40
  (`#3165 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/3165>`_)

* Fixed occasional reboot issues on some TP-Link WDR3600 and WDR4300 devices
  (`Upstream <https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/issues/13043>`_)
  (`#2904 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/2904>`_)
  


Known issues
------------

* Unstable wireless with certain MediaTek devices (`#3154 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/3154>`_)

* The integration of the BATMAN_V routing algorithm is incomplete.

  - Mesh neighbors don't appear on the status page. (`#1726 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1726>`_)
    Many tools have the BATMAN_IV metric hardcoded, these need to be updated to account for the new throughput
    metric.
  - Throughput values are not correctly acquired for different interface types.
    (`#1728 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1728>`_)
    This affects virtual interface types like bridges and VXLAN.

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown
  (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* In configurations without VXLAN, the MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled
  (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promiscuous mode is disallowed).
