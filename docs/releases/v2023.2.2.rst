Gluon 2023.2.2
==============

Bugfixes
--------

* Fixed a bug where nodes connected using VXLAN would lose connectivity to all but one neighbor 
  (`#3191 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/3191>`_)  

* fastd-l2tp VPN did not re-generate the flow-label for the inner-tunnel traffic,
  breaking QoS mechanisms 
  (`#3203 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/3203>`_)  

* Fixed silent-failures when image-customization files were not valid
  (`#3218 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/3218>`_)

* Multicast-snooping did stop working after extended uptime periods
  (`#3176 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/3176>`_)


Known issues
------------

* Unstable wireless with certain MediaTek devices (`#3154 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/3154>`_)

* The integration of the BATMAN_V routing algorithm is incomplete.

  - Mesh neighbors don't appear on the status page. (`#1726 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1726>`_)
    Many tools have the BATMAN_IV metric hardcoded, these need to be updated to account for the new throughput
    metric.
  - Throughput values are not correctly acquired for different interface types.
    (`#1728 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1728>`_)
    This affects virtual interface types like bridges and VXLAN.

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown
  (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* In configurations without VXLAN, the MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled
  (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promiscuous mode is disallowed).
